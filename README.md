# ASCII Art Converter <br>

This project converts uploaded picture into ASCII format. You can upload any image and it will be turned into a text that consists of characters.<br>

### CodeUmoja

It is a subproject of CodeUmoja project. We will merge our subprojects in future.

### How does it work?

Firstly, the uploaded picture should be turned to grayscale. Than a character is chosen for every pixel depend on its brightness. 
Also I added a possibility to choose a color and size for our art.
